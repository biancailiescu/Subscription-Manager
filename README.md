The application allows users to create an account and log in, then have the opportunity to add their monthly subscriptions by specifying the name, price, category and start date. When a user has a subscription added to their account, they can view the number of days until the next payment and statistics on the total monthly cost and the distribution of subscriptions by category. A user can also change the price or date of the subscription and delete it if they want to remove it from the list.
